# Type system

## Nullable reference types (C# 8)

Up to this point, nothing in the language lets you express whether a reference (either as a return value, a parameter, or just a local variable) might be null. This leads to error-prone code if you’re not careful and boilerplate validation code if you are careful, neither of which is ideal.

Consider the following example:

```cs
string Method(string x, string? y)
```

The parameter types indicate that the argument corresponding to x shouldn’t be null
but that the argument corresponding to y may be null. The return type indicates that
the method won’t return null.
## Anonymous types and implicitly typed local variables (var) (C# 3)

These help address the downside of some statically typed languages: **verbosity**.

If you need a particular data shape within a single method but nowhere else, creating a whole extra type just for the sake of that method is overkill. Anonymous types allow that data shape to be expressed concisely without losing the benefits of static typing:

```cs
var book = new { Title = "Lost in the Snow", Author = "Holly Webb" };
string title = book.Title;
string author = book.Author;
```

Similarly, it seems redundant to explicitly specify the type of a variable that is initialized in the same statement by calling the constructor of that type.

```cs
//Explicit typing
Dictionary<string, string> map1 = new Dictionary<string, string>();

//Implicit typing
var map2 = new Dictionary<string, string>();
```
